# MedRex

The goal for the initial version is tracking vaccination records.

## Why am I building it?

I've decided to build this as a passion project to help a friend. She is struggling with Excel sheets at her job and does not have a budget for software. I figured why not build it myself ðŸ˜Š

## Why name it MedRex?

The purpose of the app is to track medical records. When creating the project I was typing "medrecs-app" and realized I could shorten it to "rex". The possibilities for T-rex imagery are too good to pass up!
